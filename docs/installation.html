        <summary>
        There are two conventional methods for getting Glossolalia on to your system: as a package in an existing installation of the Racket
        programming language, or as a standalone executable.
        </summary>

        <section id="hashlang">
            <h4>1. As a <code>#lang</code> in Racket</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure you have a relatively recent version of <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> installed.</li>
                <li>Open a terminal and type <code>raco pkg install glossolalia</code></li>
                <li>Run your Glossolalia files using the <code>racket &lt;myconlang.rkt&gt;</code> command or open them in Dr. Racket and hit the play button.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This option is the recommended one at the moment, as it is cross-platform and gives you all the good things about Racket, including the
            Dr. Racket IDE. However, it also means you have to install Racket, which could be annoying if all you want is this tool.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="standalone">
            <h4>2. As a standalone application (currently Windows only)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the <a href="TODO INSTALL">latest stable release</a> and unzip it into the desired location.</li>
                <li>Run the included executable <code>glossolalia.exe</code> from the command line on your source file.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Unfortunately, this option isn't as nice as it could be just yet, only supporting Windows and with no installer, which means you'll
            have to add it to the path yourself if you want to use it from anywhere.</p>
