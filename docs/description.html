            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In both methods, the generated word list appears by default in the file <code>generated.txt</code> in the working directory.
                When starting Dr. Racket without a pre-existing file, the current directory is the user's home directory.</p>
            <h4>Command Line</h4>
            <p>If you have Racket installed, you can run any of your Glossolalia files from whichever directory they are in:</p>
            <code>racket example_lang.rkt</code>
            <p>If you are using the prepackaged executable, you will have to add it to your path before being able to do the same, or
            put all your language files in the same directory as the executable. It can be run on Windows with:</p>
            <code>./glossolalia.exe example_lang.rkt</code>
            <p><span style="color: red;">Warning: </span>When running from the executable, do not include the <code>#lang glossolalia</code>
            line at the top of the code! Otherwise you will get a lexer error.</p>

            <h4>Dr. Racket IDE</h4>
            <p>Just open up your file in the Dr. Racket IDE and hit the 'Run' button.</p>

            <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Each Glossolalia file is divided into four sections: the <em>sounds</em> section; the <em>syllables</em> section;
               the <em>filter and transformation rules</em> section; and the <em>configuration</em> section. All four sections must be present
               and occur in the order listed from top to bottom (as shown in the template portion of the <a href="./index.html">examples page</a>).
               Each section is required to begin with its title. For instance, the sounds section is preceded by the word <code>Sounds</code>,
               the syllables section is preceded by the word <code>Syllables</code>, etc.</p>
            
            <h4>Sounds Section</h4>
            <p>The sounds section is made up of one or more <em>sound groups</em> and cannot be empty in any valid file. As many sound groups
               as the user desires can be named, each with as many 'sounds' as desired. Sounds in Glossolalia are not sounds proper, just written
               representations of sounds: you can use the name <code>alakazam</code> to stand for the sound of English 'f', if you wish, though sound
               names with more than three letters are commonly discouraged (see the German-ish example for a justified exception).</p>
            <p>Each sound group follows the same format: first, a <a href="#group-name">group name</a>, followed by an equal sign, follwed by a comma separated
               list of <a href="#sound-name">sound names</a>. The list of sound names cannot be empty. In addition, each sound name may specify a
               <a href="#percentage">percentage</a>, which represents the probability that the sound will be chosen out of the group. Every sound name
               may specify a percentage, but if not all of them do, the probabilities of the remaining sound names are distributed equally from the
               remaining percentage after subtracting the specified percentages from 100.</p>
            <code class="block">&lt;sound-group&gt; ::= GROUP_NAME "=" &lt;sound&gt; ["," &lt;sound&gt;]*
&lt;sound&gt; ::= SOUND_NAME ["=" PERCENTAGE]</code>

            <h4>Syllables Section</h4>
            <p>Individual sounds are the most basic element of a generated word. Syllables are constructed from one or more sounds, pulled randomly
               from the specified sound groups. Syllables are also put into named groups, so that certain syllable patterns may be enforced or disallowed
               by filtering rules. There must be at least one syllable group, and within each variant of the group, one or more sound groups must be
               listed. Sounds will be chosen from the groups in the order they are listed, and will appear in the final generated word in that order.
               Syllable groups may have an attached percentage, to make certain syllable kinds occur more frequently, and within groups each syllable
               variant may also have a percentage to further refine the frequency.</p>
            <p>Syllable groups follow a similar format to sound groups: each syllable group begins with a <a href="#syllable-name">syllable name</a>,
               optionally followed by a percentage. Next comes the equal sign, followed by a bar <code>|</code> separated list of syllable variants.
               A syllable variant is a list of one or more group names, each with an optional percentage.</p>
            <code class="block">&lt;syll-group&gt; ::= SYLLABLE_NAME [":" PERCENTAGE] "=" &lt;vari-list&gt;
&lt;vari-list&gt; ::= &lt;syll-variant&gt; ["|" &lt;syll-variant&gt;]*
&lt;syll-variant&gt; ::= GROUP_NAME+ ["=" PERCENTAGE]</code>

            <h4>Rules Section</h4>
            <p>There are two types of rule in Glossolalia: <em>filtering</em> rules and <em>transformation</em> rules. Filtering rules check if a generated
               word includes disallowed sound or syllable combinations, and keeps the word from being added to the generated word list if so. Transformation
               rules change sound combinations that occur in a word to be some other sound, and can even be used to delete sounds in some instances.
               All transformation rules are executed <em>after</em> the prospective word has passed all the filtering rules, and transformation rules are
               applied cumulatively to a word, from top to bottom in the order they are written in the file.</p>
            <p>Filtering rules may include a mix of sound and group names as arguments, or syllable names. Syllable name arguments cannot co-occur with
               sound or group name arguments, as they operate on a different view of the word. Transformation rules only allow sound and group names
               as arguments.</p>
            <p>Rules come in three varieties: <em>unary</em>, <em>binary</em>, and <em>ternary</em>. Unary rules take a comma-separated list of arguments
               before the keyword that names the rule. Binary rules take a comma-separated list of arguments on either side of the keyword that names the
               rule. Ternary rules have two keywords that 'name' them. Both ends of the rule take a comma-separated list of arguments, and the keywords are
               separated by zero or more sound names. Currently, all ternary rules are transformation rules, and all transformation rules are ternary.
               Future versions of Glossolalia may not have this limitation.</p>
            <code>&lt;rule&gt; ::= &lt;unary-rule&gt; | &lt;binary-rule&gt; | &lt;ternary-rule&gt;
&lt;unary-rule&gt; ::= &lt;arg-list&gt; UNARY_RULE_NAME
&lt;binary-rule&gt; ::= &lt;arg-list&gt; BINARY_RULE_NAME &lt;arg-list&gt;
&lt;ternary-rule&gt; ::= &lt;arg-list&gt; TERNARY_RULE_PRIM SOUND_NAME* TERNARY_RULE_SUB &lt;arg-list&gt;</code>
            <p>Most of the rule names follow a pattern and are fairly intuitive. The handling of multiple arguments in a rule is shorthand for spreading
               the arguments out over multiple rules. So a rule like:</p>
            <code class="block">q, k never-followed-by g, v</code>
            <p>is equivalent to writing:</p>
            <code class="block">q never-followed-by g
q never-followed-by v
k never-followed-by g
k never-followed-by v</code>
            <p>The shorthand version does have the potential to be more efficient when generating much larger lists of words. Here is a list of all
               the rules Glossolalia currently supports.</p>

            <h4>Configuration Section</h4>
            <p>The configuration section is a list of key-value pairs, where each value is either an <a href="#integer">integer</a>
               or a <a href="#string">string</a>. Each key-value pair is separated by an equal sign, and looks like
               <code>KEYWORD "=" VALUE</code>. There are seven allowed keys, and each has a default value which is specified below.
               Only the last two fields are string typed, while the first five take integers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Seed</code> - Allows to generate a different word list (default: <code>9001</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Count</code> - The number of words to generate (default: <code>100</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Shortest</code> - The lowest possible number of syllables in a generated word (default: <code>1</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Longest</code> - The biggest possible number of syllables in a generated word (default: <code>5</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Mode</code> - The average number of syllables in the generated words (default: <code>(Longest - Shortest) / 2</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Path</code> - The directory in which the output file will be generated (default: <code>(current-directory)</code>)</li>
                <li><code>File</code> - The name of the output file, without the extension (default: <code>"generated"</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <code>Shortest</code>, <code>Longest</code>, and <code>Mode</code> keywords together define a <em>triangle distribution</em>, which
               is sampled when generating the 'random' number of syllables in each word. As a result, most generated words should have a syllable count closer
               to <code>Mode</code> than to either of the ends.</p>

               The string cannot contain double quotes within it, but this is fine since strings are only used for path and file names in Glossolalia
               anyway.</p>
